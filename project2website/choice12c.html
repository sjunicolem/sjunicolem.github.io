Why are you saying thank you?
<br>
Are you thanking the world?
<br>
Are you happy to be in bed again?
<br>
You're awake.
<br>
It was just a nightmare.
<br>
Or even a strange dream.
<br>>
<br>>
<br>>
<br>>
<br>
You softly hug your wolf plushie.
<br>
Blow a kiss at your pet frog.
<br>>
<br>>
<br>>
<br>
You’re home...

For real this time.

<br>
You smell breakfast from here.
