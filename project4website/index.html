    <h1>Why Hollow Knight: Silksong?
    </h1>
    This game means so much to me, after being confirmed as a sequel for Hollow Knight instead of a prequel title I just wanted more content even after I was done. The difficulty level of the game makes it satisfying yet intense, if it were easy I feel like I wouldn't have had as much fun. After watching a lore video years ago to playing both Hollow Knight and Hollow Knight: Silksong, this is my own little homage to specifcally Spilksong with my 99.9 hours on steam.
    <br>It's so peak. 
    <br>I mean just look at baby Hornet :(
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>What Is Hollow Knight: Silksong?
    </h2>
    Hollow Knight: Silksong is the sequel to Hollow Knight, it explores the world of Pharloom inhabited by bugs that are plagued with the dream of wanting to go to the Citadel, their version of a holy land. But what the Citadel lies is far from holy with secrets and treasures to uncover as you go to the top to fight whatevers at the top. It feels like a dark souls game, it isn't a dark souls game, but it is still an RPG.

A fan favorite due to her importance in the story. Though here her encounter feels random and surprising in a good way.

    The Far Fields area has a lot going in if you think about all the area it connects to and end game content importance. It's a nice entrance in terms of the bosses to get to know the game with Karmelita being end game. By far the most notable thing in my opinion due to her music in the fight.

    Hunters March is regarded as a hard and dangerous area for early game due to the enemies as well as the new parkour system introduced. In Hollow Knight you'd do down attacks on specific world structures like spikes or enemies in order to parkour, in Silksong it's mostly just ball objects and some use enemies.

    Shellwood...is interesting for one particular reason. Theres an item you need for 100% that also unlocks a secret ending with the "final boss" of the game. The quest itself for the item is dark, unnerving, and overall unenjoyable as it just makes the game harder for a bit. The area itself without that factor is fun to traverse and important for other lore reasons.

    The image shows a weirdness and unnerve to when you first enter Bellhart. It's called "Haunted Bellhart" due to all the citizens being hung up by webs created by an unknown entity who is the boss of this area. This entity is extremely important to the lore and once defeared, you get to see the lively but very small area of Bellhart start to feel like a home. Bellhart is the second hub in the game.

There are now pits filled with these more violent and smaller versions that can't be killed.

Overall a very hateful experience until you get use to it with every miss or fall having the ability to cost you your life or your time.

    The Underworks is right after the Grand Gate, the elevator upwards to what should have been the next area "Choral Chambers" broke and sent itself all the way down here. As it's names it is the underbelly of the Citadel, where all the workers try their hardest to one day be recognized for the god who rules Pharloom. The bosses are strictly from the end game.

    The Choral Chambers, although lively with workers, still feels so empty and useless. It's the connector to every area in the Citadel, so high importance in terms of the endgame or so I thought. The game has so much more content in store, but the Choral Chambers was still a nice place to wrap everything up nicely if you didn't want to partake in the secret last act.

This area also introduces you to the difficulty of parkour moving forward, it did increase by a lot but still pretty fun.

    I hate it. I just hate it. This area isn't as annoying as one coming up but it was definitely in experience to behold. It houses the boss that made me start losing hope in beating the game any quicker then I was. It has a lot more maggot infested waters and parkour, so one wrong move means you get infected in an area that is difficult to heal in. It's also the area where you get the item needed for the quest in shellwood, the secret ending.

    <h1>----Cogwork Core (Upper) (Act 2)----
    </h1>
    This is the Cogwork Core's upper layer. It contains the last/third part of the Threefold Melody, now allowing for the activation of the elevator up to the "end of the game" where you finally meet the one above all. This area is only really note worthy for collecting the third part after completing its parkour section. The "end" is almost near.

    </h1>
    The Cradle is the "final" area of the game, you finally meet the one above all, the god of Pharloom, Grand Mother Silk. We learn that Lace is her daughter as well as Phantom tho Phantom was a failed experiment to create a sentient being of Silk. The Cradle is inetersting for its lore and the tiny parkour section creating excitement and readiness to free Pharloom for good...unless you go for the true ending.

    The Coral Tower is accessible though the Sands Of Karak after entering a dream world through Crust King Khann's corpse, the first figure of the clans before Grand Mother Silks reign. The area is only there for this fight but the structure itself and the new enemies make it feel like it's own thing. Sands Of Karak also has a new dream boss in Act 3.

    The endgame in the Underworks is accessable after breaking a wall. You fight the guardian to then fight Nytleth, the second figure of the clans before Grand Mother Silks reign. The area is nature heavy with nothing truly notable other then Nyleths statue with words of praise and reverance.

    The end game content in the Far Fields contains the aging yet living Skarrsinger Karmelita, the third figure of the clans before Grand Mother Silks reign. The area is quite expansive with it's new content and parkour heavy with it's clear connections to Hunters March.

    As you beat the Cogwork Dancers from earlier you meet the prince you rescued in Sinners Road, this prince's home was Lost Verdania with his lover. His lover created the Cogwork Dancers and you gain the curiosity to enter the prince's mind and learn about this long ago area. It's quite pretty with different tests to progress and fight this ghostly reunited couple and of their prized possesion.

    <h1>----Extra Bosses----
    </h1>
    These 2 bosses are ones I did not fight. Shakra's fight is unknown to me as to how and where it coccurs, the Summoned Saviour is fought in the Soul Steel mode of the game, or the harder more hardcore version. It makes the game near impossible for many so I do not feel like partaking in it.
