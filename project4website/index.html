    <h1>Why Hollow Knight: Silksong?
    </h1>
    This game means so much to me, after being confirmed as a sequel for Hollow Knight instead of a prequel title I just wanted more content even after I was done. The difficulty level of the game makes it satisfying yet intense, if it were easy I feel like I wouldn't have had as much fun. After watching a lore video years ago to playing both Hollow Knight and Hollow Knight: Silksong, this is my own little homage to specifcally Silksong with my 99.9 hours on steam.
    <br>It's so peak. 
    <br>The music is masterfully crafted and orchestrated.
    <br>I mean just look at baby Hornet :(
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>What Is Hollow Knight: Silksong?
    </h2>
    Hollow Knight: Silksong is the sequel to Hollow Knight, it explores the world of Pharloom inhabited by bugs that are plagued with the dream of wanting to go to the Citadel, their version of a holy land. But what the Citadel lies is far from holy with secrets and treasures to uncover as you go to the top to fight whatevers at the top. It feels like a dark souls game, it isn't a dark souls game, but it is still an RPG.

    The Far Fields area has a lot going in if you think about all the area it connects to and end game content importance. It's a nice entrance in terms of the bosses to get to know the game with Karmelita being end game. By far the most notable thing in my opinion due to her music in the fight.

    Hunters March is regarded as a hard and dangerous area for early game due to the enemies as well as the new parkour system introduced.

It's neccesary to kill it for 100% so this made it even more annoying and angering.

    Shellwood...is interesting for one particular reason. Theres an item you need for 100% that also unlocks a secret ending with the "final boss" of the game. The quest itself for the item is dark, unnerving, and overall unenjoyable as it just makes the game harder for a bit.

This entity is extremely important to the lore and once defeared, you get to see the lively but very small area of Bellhart start to feel like a home. Bellhart is the second hub in the game.

              <h1>Great Conchflies</h1>
              The Great Conchflies is a pretty easy fight, it leads to one of the other bosses almost like a tragic loves story between the two. You kill one then the other comes back for revenge with their children. It's the barrier between the Sands Of Karak and the 
              <br>Coral Tower.

              The Last Judge was extremely annoying and took like 2 days to beat, yet still I don't hate it. It was a cool boss and the difficulty is what makes this game so satisying and enjoying. He stands as the guardian before the gate into the citadel.

It has a lot more maggot infested waters and parkour, so one wrong move means you get infected in an area that is difficult to heal in.

              <h1>Raging Conchfly</h1>
              The Raging Conchfly fighting for revenge and the barrier between the Sands Of Karak and the Coral Tower. Fighting with itself and the other Conchfly's children the fight itself isn't very difficult but does take a minute due to the childrens line of attack. Overall is sad.

              Voltvrym was EXTREMELY EASY for this stage of the game. It gives you an item that isn't that crazy in endgame but the boss itself is very forgettable with not that much importance and also very hidden.

    <h2>The Difficulty Tier List
    </h2>
    The first tier list is for difficulty. The game itself is very difficult and patience reliant due to the different rng elements with what move the boss will do left, will you have time to heal, and does this boss have another phase that's going to steamroll you if you aren't careful.
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>The Appreciation Tier List
    </h2>
    The second tier list is for appreciation. The game tho seen as difficult and off-putting becuase if it, theres so much beauty in the difficulty and the design. Due to it being an indie game company known as Team Cherry who did it, it takes time and love and the game got delayed god knows how many times because the studio was having too much fun...Anyway. The game is amazing, lovely, I'd say a masterpiece thats one of my favorite games EVER.
